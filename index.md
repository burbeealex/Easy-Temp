The most popular product we offor is called our Silver system. This product allows a standard cold bar to be monitored repotley either on our app or on a computer. This system is designed for both hot and cold food enviroments. For example, in a cold bar, Each panis equipped with our device that monitors the temperature of the pan and relays the current temperature to the controller. The controller then processes and displays all the current temperaures on the app. Each reading can be changed to display what is in the pan. Temperature tolerances can be added to notify managers and employees when food temperatures reach above a given temperature. Temperature logs are kept for six months and can be viewed by managers.
