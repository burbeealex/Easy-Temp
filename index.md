### The Silver Package

The most popular product we offer is called our Silver Package. This product allows a standard cold bar to be monitored remotely either on our app or on a computer and comes with 12 sensors and a controler. This system is designed for both hot and cold food enviroments. For example, in a cold bar, each pan is equipped with our device that monitors the temperature of the pan and relays the current temperature to the controller. The controller processes and displays all the current temperaures on the app or computer and stores a temperature history for up to six months. Temperature tolerances can be added to notify managers when food temperatures reach above a a set temperature so the food are maintained at safe temperatures. This system is far more accurate and safer than having employees check the temperature throughout the day.
